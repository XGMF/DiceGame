Dice Blackjack.

A console based blackjack game
Initial project Requirements
Your Customer / Project Owner wants you to implement a console based blackjack game with 2 dice. The human player plays against the computer.

REQ-1: The human players starts.
REQ-2: At start, the player gets 2 random numbers.
REQ-3: The random number are summed up.
REQ-4: The player can then choose to hold or roll again the dice.
REQ-5: If they chooses to roll again, numbers are added to the previous sum.
REQ-6: If the player holds, it’s the computer’s turn.
REQ-7: The closest to 21 without going over is the winner.

These initial requirements are inadequate for complete coding of the requested game.
We asked the client for any requirements we were uncertain on. 

REQ-8: The dice should return numbers through 1 to 6 inclusive.
REQ-9: The random numbers are taken from the dice, which are rolled at the beginning of 	the game.
REQ-10:The computer will hold when within range of the 21 number target. The range is 	decided by a common dice roll. Eg, 7.
REQ-11:Should a player get 21 (which is the target), nothing should happen as it is NOT 	OVER the target.
REQ-12:If both players get equal totals at the end of the game, the game is a draw.
REQ-13: The game is ended as soon as a player goes over 21.
REQ-14:Display end of game totals
REQ-15:Announce who wins
REQ-16:Pause the game at the end, as to prevent the console application from closing without response.
